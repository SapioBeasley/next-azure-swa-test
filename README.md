# Create next (latest) project

$ npx create-next-app@latest {project-name}

use noStore(); to dynamically render component if needed (What is this actually doing? Date is still incrementing on refresh)

Note
This example forces dynamic rendering of this component to demonstrate server-rendering of the server's current time. The App Router model of Next.js recommends caching individual data requests to optimize the performance of your Next.js app. Read more on data fetching and caching in Next.js

NOTE
When application size exceeds 250 MB, the Next.js Output File Tracing feature helps optimize the app size and enhance performance. https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output
